fix: resolve IDE pause issues from supabase_flutter internal exceptions

## Problem
- IDE was pausing unexpectedly during Supabase initialization
- Caused by TimeoutException from Hive migration (Issue #794)
- Debugger was catching exceptions before silent catch blocks

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Custom LocalStorage without Hive
- Created `CustomLocalStorage` class that bypasses Hive completely
- Uses SharedPreferences directly for session persistence
- Eliminates timeout exceptions during initialization
- No migration overhead or complexity

### 2. VS Code Debug Configuration
- Updated `.vscode/launch.json` with:
  - `debugExternalPackageLibraries: false` - don't debug external packages
  - `debugSdkLibraries: false` - don't debug SDK libraries
  - `stopOnException: none` - don't pause on exceptions

### 3. Modified Supabase Initialization
- Updated `main.dart` to use CustomLocalStorage
- Maintains proper session key naming convention
- Preserves all security measures

## Trade-offs
- ⚠️ Existing Hive sessions will NOT be migrated automatically
- Users will need to login again after this update
- This is acceptable to eliminate debug interruptions

## Benefits
✅ No unexpected IDE pauses
✅ Faster initialization
✅ Cleaner debug experience
✅ No Hive dependency for auth storage

## Testing
- Analyzed with `flutter analyze` - no issues
- Compatible with current supabase_flutter ^2.10.3
